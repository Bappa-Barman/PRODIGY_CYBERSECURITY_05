1. PRODIGY_CYBERSECURITY_05 - Network Packet Analyzer
    This project is part of my internship at Prodigy Infotech under the domain of Cybersecurity In this task, I have built a simple network packet analyzer using Python that captures and displays the source IP, destination IP, and protocol of the packets passing through the network.

2. Tech Used
   - Python
   - socket module (standard library)
  
3. Objective
   - To create a Python-based packet sniffer that:
   - Captures real-time packets
   - Extracts source & destination IP addresses
   - Identifies the protocol used (TCP/UDP/etc.)

4. How to Run the Program
   - Open the Project in VS Code
   - Run as Administrator Because raw sockets require admin rights:
   - Right click an Run the Program
   - Stop the Program Press Ctrl + C to stop the packet capturing safely.

5.  What I Learned
   - Working with low-level network access using sockets
   - Basics of TCP/UDP/IP protocols
   - Importance of admin permissions for sniffing tools
   - How to monitor live network traffic using Python
